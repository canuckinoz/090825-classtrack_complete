# ClassTrack

Small classroom tracking app using React (CRA) and Express.

## Quick start (dev)
- Backend: `npm run server:dev` (http://localhost:3005)
- Frontend: `npm run web:dev` (http://localhost:5173)

## Dev login
On the login page, click "Use demo teacher" to sign in as a demo teacher for `CLASS-3A`. This calls `/dev-login` on the backend and redirects back to the app.
This project is now deployed with Blitzy.
