# ClassTrack Code Audit

## Overview

This document summarises the code audit findings for the ClassTrack application, combining findings from multiple branches.

## Combined Findings

- Authentication in development mode is incomplete, leading to errors such as "Cannot GET /".

- The proxy configuration is incorrect, forwarding root requests to the backend improperly.

- Lack of consistent code formatting and linting rules across the codebase.

- Insufficient test coverage, particularly in integration and end-to-end tests.

- Potential security vulnerabilities in session management.

- Code duplication in frontend components.

- Missing type checking in some TypeScript files.

- Outdated dependencies that may pose security risks.

## Recommendations

- Complete development authentication setup.

- Correct proxy to only handle /api and /dev-login paths.

- Implement Prettier and ESLint for code style enforcement.

- Add more unit, integration, and e2e tests.

- Review and update session middleware.

- Refactor duplicated code.

- Enable strict type checking.

- Update all dependencies to latest versions.

This represents the fuller combined findings after resolving the merge conflict.
