# ClassTrack Code Audit

This document summarizes the findings of a comprehensive code audit of the ClassTrack application. It covers the overall architecture, code quality, performance, security, and testing strategy.

## 1. Overall Architecture & Design

### Weaknesses

*   **Inconsistent Routing**: The application uses a custom state management solution (`useStore`) to control the `currentView` instead of a dedicated routing library like React Router. This is not a standard or scalable approach.
*   **Mixed State Management**: The application uses both Zustand (`useStore`) and a custom `GlobalProvider` for state management. This creates confusion and makes the application harder to maintain.
*   **Lack of Modularity**: The dashboards are conditionally rendered in the `App` component based on the `currentView` state. This is not a modular or scalable approach.
*   **Authorization Logic in UI**: The authorization logic is implemented directly in the `App` component, which makes it less reusable and harder to maintain.

### Recommendations

*   **Adopt React Router**: Use React Router for all navigation and routing within the application. This will provide a more standard and scalable solution.
*   **Consolidate State Management**: Migrate all state management to Zustand. This will create a single source of truth and make the application easier to reason about.
*   **Create a Layout Component**: Create a layout component that handles the rendering of the navigation and the main content area. This will improve the modularity of the application.
*   **Create a `PrivateRoute` Component**: Create a `PrivateRoute` component that handles the authorization logic. This will make the authorization logic more reusable and easier to maintain.

## 2. Code Quality & Best Practices

### Weaknesses

*   **Mix of JavaScript and TypeScript**: The project uses a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript. While this is not necessarily a problem, it can lead to inconsistencies.
*   **"Code Smells"**: There are some "code smells" in the codebase, such as the use of a custom state management solution for routing.

### Recommendations

*   **Be Consistent**: Be consistent with the use of JavaScript and TypeScript. If possible, migrate the entire codebase to TypeScript.
*   **Refactor "Code Smells"**: Refactor the "code smells" in the codebase to improve the overall quality of the code.

## 3. Performance & Scalability

### Weaknesses

*   **In-Memory Database**: The server uses an in-memory database, which is not suitable for production.
*   **No Input Validation**: There is no input validation on the request bodies, which can lead to performance issues and security vulnerabilities.

### Recommendations

*   **Use a Real Database**: Use a real database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB, for the server.
*   **Add Input Validation**: Add input validation to all request bodies to prevent performance issues and security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Bugs, Weaknesses & Security

### Weaknesses

*   **Passwords Not Hashed**: Passwords are not hashed in the in-memory user object. This is a major security vulnerability.
*   **Hardcoded JWT Secret**: The JWT secret is hardcoded and should be stored in an environment variable.

### Recommendations

*   **Hash Passwords**: Hash all passwords before storing them in the database.
*   **Use Environment Variables for Secrets**: Store all secrets, such as the JWT secret, in environment variables.

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Weaknesses

*   **Limited Test Coverage**: The test coverage is limited. There are no tests for the server-side code, and the client-side tests only cover a small portion of the application.
*   **No End-to-End Tests**: There are no end-to-end tests, which makes it difficult to test the application as a whole.

### Recommendations

*   **Increase Test Coverage**: Increase the test coverage for both the client-side and server-side code.
*   **Add End-to-End Tests**: Add end-to-end tests to test the application as a whole.
*   **Test the Server**: Add tests for the server-side code to ensure that the API endpoints are working correctly.
